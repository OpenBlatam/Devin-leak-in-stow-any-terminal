Sure, I'd be happy to provide some personalized advice based on your Codeforces data. Let me first take a look at your profile details from To fetch the user details for the given Codeforces handles, we can use the Codeforces API. Here's an example Python script that retrieves the requested information for each handle:

import requests

# List of Codeforces handles
handles = [
    'tourist', 'jiangly', 'Benq', 'ecnerwala', 'orzdevinwang', 'Geothermal', 'cnnfls_csy', 'Radewoosh',
    'jqdai0815', 'gyh20', 'Canadaksun48', 'ChinaRebelz', 'Японияmaroonrk', 'United KingdomUm_nik',
    'SwitzerlandPetr', 'Chinaugly2333', 'United Statesconqueror_of_tourist'
]

# API endpoint for user.info
api_url = 'https://codeforces.com/api/user.info'

# Fetch user details for each handle
for handle in handles:
    params = {'handles': handle}
    response = requests.get(api_url, params=params).json()

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response['status'] == 'OK':
        user_info = response['result'][0]
        rating = user_info['rating']
        rank = user_info['rank']
        max_rating = user_info['maxRating']
        recent_performance = user_info['maxRank']

        print(f"Handle: {handle}")
        print(f"Rating: {rating}")
        print(f"Rank: {rank}")
        print(f"Maximum Rating: {max_rating}")
        print(f"Recent Performance: {recent_performance}")
        print()
    else:
        print(f"Error fetching details for {handle}: {response['comment']}")
        print()
This script sends a GET request to the Codeforces API's user.info endpoint for each handle in the list. The API response contains various details about the user, including their rating, rank, maximum rating, and a brief summary of their recent performance (represented by maxRank).

The script then prints out the requested information for each handle. If the API request fails for any handle, an error message is displayed instead.

Note that this script assumes that all the handles in the list are valid and exist on Codeforces. If a handle is invalid or doesn't exist, the API will return an error, which is handled by the script. and your recent contest performance from Unfortunately, I do not have access to the specific contest participation details of individual users on competitive programming platforms. These platforms typically do not share such granular user data publicly. However, I can provide you with a general overview of how competitive programming contests work and the types of information that are usually available.

In competitive programming contests, participants are given a set of algorithmic problems to solve within a specific time frame. They write code to solve these problems, and their submissions are evaluated based on factors such as correctness, efficiency, and time taken to solve the problem.

The performance of participants is typically ranked based on the number of problems they solved correctly and the time taken to solve them. The ranking may also consider other factors like the difficulty level of the problems solved.

Some common performance metrics that may be available for a user in a contest include:

Ranking: The position of the user in the overall contest ranking.
Score: The total score accumulated by the user based on the problems solved and the time taken.
Problems solved: The number of problems the user solved correctly during the contest.
Penalty time: The total time penalty incurred by the user for incorrect submissions or other penalties.
Submission details: Information about the user's submissions for each problem, such as the time of submission, the verdict (accepted or wrong answer), and the execution time or memory usage.
However, please note that the availability and format of this information may vary across different competitive programming platforms and contests....

create a devin in nix for auto completation in implementations in githubs

Sure, I can help you create a Nix derivation for auto-completion in implementations on GitHub. Nix is a powerful package manager and build system that can be used to manage development environments and build artifacts.

Here's an example of a Nix derivation that sets up a development environment with auto-completion support for various programming languages:

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  # Define the list of programming languages and their respective auto-completion tools
  languages = [
    { name = "python"; tool = pkgs.python-language-server; }
    { name = "go"; tool = pkgs.gopls; }
    { name = "rust"; tool = pkgs.rust-analyzer; }
    { name = "javascript"; tool = pkgs.nodePackages.typescript-language-server; }
    { name = "typescript"; tool = pkgs.nodePackages.typescript-language-server; }
    { name = "cpp"; tool = pkgs.clang-tools; }
    { name = "c"; tool = pkgs.clang-tools; }
  ];

  # Create a list of auto-completion tools based on the defined languages
  autoCompletionTools = builtins.concatMap (lang: [lang.tool]) languages;

  # Define the development environment with auto-completion tools
  devEnv = pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = autoCompletionTools ++ [
      # Add any additional tools or dependencies here
      pkgs.git
      pkgs.vim
      pkgs.neovim
    ];
  };
in
devEnv
This Nix expression defines a development environment (devEnv) that includes auto-completion tools for various programming languages, as well as additional tools like Git, Vim, and Neovim.

Here's how it works:

The languages list defines the programming languages and their respective auto-completion tools. You can add or remove languages as needed.
The autoCompletionTools list is created by concatenating the auto-completion tools for each language defined in the languages list.
The devEnv is created using pkgs.mkShell, which sets up a shell environment with the specified buildInputs. In this case, the buildInputs include the auto-completion tools from autoCompletionTools, as well as additional tools like Git, Vim, and Neovim.
To use this Nix derivation, save it to a file (e.g., shell.nix) in your project directory. Then, you can enter the development environment by running nix-shell in the same directory.

Once inside the development environment, you can use the auto-completion tools and other tools included in the buildInputs. For example, if you're using Neovim, you can configure it to use the auto-completion tools for the respective programming languages.

Note that this is a basic example, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements. You can customize the list of programming languages, add additional tools or dependencies, or modify the configuration as needed.

in lua

Sure, here's an example of a Nix derivation for setting up a development environment with auto-completion support for Lua implementations on GitHub:

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  # Define the Lua auto-completion tool
  luaLanguageServer = pkgs.lua-language-server;

  # Define the development environment with Lua auto-completion
  devEnv = pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = [
      luaLanguageServer
      # Add any additional tools or dependencies here
      pkgs.lua
      pkgs.luarocks
      pkgs.git
      pkgs.vim
      pkgs.neovim
    ];
  };
in
devEnv
In this example, we define a luaLanguageServer variable that points to the lua-language-server package from the Nixpkgs repository. This package provides auto-completion support for Lua.

The devEnv is created using pkgs.mkShell, which sets up a shell environment with the specified buildInputs. In this case, the buildInputs include the luaLanguageServer, as well as additional tools and dependencies like Lua, LuaRocks (a package manager for Lua), Git, Vim, and Neovim.

To use this Nix derivation, save it to a file (e.g., shell.nix) in your project directory. Then, you can enter the development environment by running nix-shell in the same directory.

Once inside the development environment, you can use the Lua auto-completion tool and other tools included in the buildInputs. For example, if you're using Neovim, you can configure it to use the Lua Language Server for auto-completion and other language features.

Here's an example of how you can configure Neovim to use the Lua Language Server:

Install the nvim-lspconfig plugin for Neovim. This plugin provides an interface for configuring and using Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients in Neovim.

Add the following configuration to your Neovim configuration file (e.g., init.vim or init.lua):

-- Lua Language Server configuration
require'lspconfig'.sumneko_lua.setup{}
This configuration tells Neovim to use the sumneko_lua LSP client, which is provided by the lua-language-server package.

With this setup, you should have auto-completion and other language features for Lua in your Neovim editor when working on Lua implementations in GitHub repositories.

Note that this is a basic example, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements. You can customize the list of tools and dependencies, or modify the configuration as needed.

with any AI agent for complete

Sure, here's an example of a Nix derivation that sets up a development environment with auto-completion support for various programming languages, including an AI agent for code completion:

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  # Define the list of programming languages and their respective auto-completion tools
  languages = [
    { name = "python"; tool = pkgs.python-language-server; }
    { name = "go"; tool = pkgs.gopls; }
    { name = "rust"; tool = pkgs.rust-analyzer; }
    { name = "javascript"; tool = pkgs.nodePackages.typescript-language-server; }
    { name = "typescript"; tool = pkgs.nodePackages.typescript-language-server; }
    { name = "cpp"; tool = pkgs.clang-tools; }
    { name = "c"; tool = pkgs.clang-tools; }
  ];

  # Create a list of auto-completion tools based on the defined languages
  autoCompletionTools = builtins.concatMap (lang: [lang.tool]) languages;

  # Define the AI agent for code completion
  codeCompletionAgent = pkgs.callPackage ./agent.nix { };

  # Define the development environment with auto-completion tools and the AI agent
  devEnv = pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = autoCompletionTools ++ [
      codeCompletionAgent
      # Add any additional tools or dependencies here
      pkgs.git
      pkgs.vim
      pkgs.neovim
    ];
  };
in
devEnv
In this example, we've added a codeCompletionAgent variable that points to a Nix expression defined in a separate file called agent.nix. This file should contain the Nix expression for building and including the AI agent for code completion in the development environment.

Here's an example of what the agent.nix file might look like:

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  # Define the AI agent for code completion
  codeCompletionAgent = pkgs.python38Packages.buildPythonPackage rec {
    pname = "code-completion-agent";
    version = "0.1.0";

    src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "your-github-username";
      repo = "code-completion-agent";
      rev = "main";
      sha256 = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef";
    };

    propagatedBuildInputs = with pkgs.python38Packages; [
      torch
      transformers
      numpy
      # Add any other dependencies required by the AI agent
    ];
  };
in
codeCompletionAgent
In this example, we define the codeCompletionAgent as a Python package built using pkgs.python38Packages.buildPythonPackage. The package is assumed to be hosted on GitHub, and the src attribute specifies the repository URL and the revision (branch or commit hash) to use.

The propagatedBuildInputs attribute lists the Python dependencies required by the AI agent, such as PyTorch, Transformers, and NumPy. You can add or remove dependencies as needed based on the requirements of your AI agent.

Note that you'll need to replace "your-github-username" and "code-completion-agent" with the appropriate values for your GitHub repository containing the AI agent code.

With this setup, the devEnv in the main Nix expression will include the AI agent for code completion, along with the auto-completion tools for various programming languages and other tools like Git, Vim, and Neovim.

To use this Nix derivation, save the main Nix expression to a file (e.g., shell.nix) and the agent.nix file in the same directory. Then, you can enter the development environment by running nix-shell in that directory.

Once inside the development environment, you can use the AI agent for code completion along with the other auto-completion tools and tools included in the buildInputs. You may need to configure your editor or IDE to integrate with the AI agent and other language servers as needed.

Note that this is a general example, and you may need to adjust it based on the specific requirements and implementation details of your AI agent for code completion.

in packer

Sure, here's an example of how you can set up a development environment with auto-completion support for various programming languages, including an AI agent for code completion, using Packer.

First, create a new file called packer.lua in your project directory with the following content:

-- Import the required modules
local use = require('packer').use
local util = require('packer.util')

-- Define the list of programming languages and their respective auto-completion tools
local languages = {
  { name = 'python', tool = 'python-language-server' },
  { name = 'go', tool = 'gopls' },
  { name = 'rust', tool = 'rust-analyzer' },
  { name = 'javascript', tool = 'typescript-language-server' },
  { name = 'typescript', tool = 'typescript-language-server' },
  { name = 'cpp', tool = 'clang-tools' },
  { name = 'c', tool = 'clang-tools' },
}

-- Define the AI agent for code completion
local codeCompletionAgent = {
  'your-github-username/code-completion-agent',
  run = ':TSInstallInfo all',
}

-- Define the Packer configuration
return require('packer').startup(function()
  -- Install the package manager itself
  use 'wbthomason/packer.nvim'

  -- Install the auto-completion tools for the defined languages
  for _, lang in ipairs(languages) do
    use {
      'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
      config = function()
        require('lspconfig')[lang.tool].setup {}
      end,
    }
  end

  -- Install the AI agent for code completion
  use(codeCompletionAgent)

  -- Install any additional tools or dependencies here
  use 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
  use 'preservim/nerdtree'
  -- ...
end)
In this example, we define a languages table that lists the programming languages and their respective auto-completion tools. You can add or remove languages as needed.

We also define a codeCompletionAgent table that specifies the GitHub repository containing the AI agent for code completion. Replace 'your-github-username/code-completion-agent' with the actual repository URL for your AI agent.

The packer.lua file then sets up the Packer configuration by calling require('packer').startup(function() ... end). Inside this function, we:

Install the packer.nvim package manager itself.
Install the nvim-lspconfig plugin and configure it to set up the auto-completion tools for each language defined in the languages table.
Install the AI agent for code completion from the specified GitHub repository.
Install any additional tools or dependencies, such as vim-fugitive and nerdtree in this example.
To use this setup, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Packer installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions in the Packer GitHub repository.

Save the packer.lua file in your Neovim configuration directory (usually ~/.config/nvim/ on Unix-like systems or ~/AppData/Local/nvim/ on Windows).

Open Neovim and run the command :PackerInstall to install the specified plugins and dependencies.

After the installation is complete, you should have auto-completion support for the defined programming languages, as well as the AI agent for code completion, available in your Neovim editor.

Note that this is a general example, and you may need to adjust it based on the specific requirements and implementation details of your AI agent for code completion. Additionally, you may need to configure your AI agent and other language servers as needed.
